# Flight_Price_Prediction
# Objective
The objective of this project is to predict flight prices given the various parameters. This will be a regression problem since the target or dependent variable is the price (continuous numeric value).

# Problem Statement
The tourism industry is changing fast and this is attracting a lot more travelers each year.
The airline industry is considered as one of the most sophisticated industry in using complex pricing strategies.
Now-a-days flight prices are quite unpredictable. The ticket prices change frequently. Customers are seeking to get the lowest price for their ticket, while airline companies are trying to keep their overall revenue as high as possible.
Using technology it is actually possible to reduce the uncertainty of flight prices. So here we will be predicting the flight prices using efficient machine learning techniques.
